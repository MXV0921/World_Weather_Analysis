# World_Weather_Analysis

In this project we focused on the functions of APIs within Python and Jupyter Notebook.  We randomly generated 2000 random locations across the globe and using the cityPy function within Python, we linked these locations to the closest available city.  Then, using OpenWeatherMap API, we pulled the current weather for each of the cities in our dataFrame.  To keep everything neat and organized we put a line in the code to ignore locations that didn't provide us with weather data. 

We next used the GoogleMaps API to take the city informartion and find hotels in the cities that we defined earlier in the project.  We also made markers with info boxes with the city and hotel information. 

We focused on locations in Sri Lanka and mapped an itinerary to hotels found in our previous search.
